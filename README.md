Foundation models are shifting the paradigm from task-specific pipelines toward interactive diagnostic copilots. Cytology, one of the highest-volume and most labor-intensive domains in pathology, has yet to fully benefit from these advances. Here we present CytoChat, the first multimodal generative AI copilot purpose-built for cytopathology. CytoChat was trained on more than 1.2 million instruction-answer pairs curated from over 650,000 public and private image-caption pairs, encompassing diverse task formats such as visual question answering, multi-turn dialogue, descriptive reporting, multiple-choice reasoning, multi-cell grounding, and referring expression comprehension. To enable rigorous evaluation, we curated and publicly released a high-quality cytology benchmark that integrates data from both private and public sources, spans the full spectrum of instruction formats, and enables direct comparison with five state-of-the-art large language model baselines. At the patch level, CytoChat outperformed all baselines across tasks, achieving an average multiple-choice accuracy of 71.0% and exceeding others by 18.5% to 41.1%. Patch-level predictions were further aggregated into robust slide-level assessments. By bridging visual understanding with multimodal reasoning and interactive guidance, CytoChat lays the foundation for next-generation cytopathology, enabling more accurate, reproducible, and collaborative diagnostics at scale.
